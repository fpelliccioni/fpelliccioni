## üëã About Me

I am a second-generation programmer who started coding at age 9, participating in my first International Olympiad in Informatics at 12. With over 36 years of programming experience and 28 years as a professional software engineer (since 1997), I specialize in high-performance computing, blockchain, and modern C++ development.

My work has been recognized with the **‚ÄúSenator Domingo Faustino Sarmiento‚Äù Honorable Mention**, the highest award granted by the Argentine Parliament, for my contributions to the National Commission on the Outer Limit of the Continental Shelf (COPLA). As part of this project, I contributed to the technical and scientific work that led to Argentina's submission to the United Nations, defining the outer limits of its continental shelf under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

I am a core developer in the Bitcoin ecosystem, with over 10 years of experience working on various full node implementations, including [Knuth](https://github.com/k-nuth/) (which I founded), [Bitcoin Cash Node](https://bitcoincashnode.org/members/fernando-pelliccioni), [Bitcoin ABC](https://www.bitcoinabc.org/) and **Bitprim**. My focus is on ensuring **Bitcoin Cash** remains true to its vision as peer-to-peer electronic cash for the world.

I have been a member of the **ISO C and C++ committees (WG14 & WG21)** since 2022, contributing to the evolution of the language. My expertise spans low-level systems programming, high-performance computing, parallel processing, and blockchain technology.

Since 2000, I have been actively developing blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions using **Solidity**, **Rust**, and other technologies. I have built and deployed multiple DeFi platforms, including decentralized exchanges (DEXes) based on Uniswap V2 and V3, a DEX aggregator, an on-chain order book system, and tokenomics mechanisms such as deflationary token models. My experience ranges from smart contract design to full-stack implementation, leveraging Rust for high-performance backend services and Solidity for secure, scalable DeFi protocols.

In recent years, I have also expanded my skills into **data science**, developing high-performance data processing solutions using **C++23** and **WebAssembly**, ensuring fast, scalable computations directly in the browser.
